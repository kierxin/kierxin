## My Projects  

### The Coolony Game: [Live Demo](https://kierxin.github.io/The-Coolony-Game/ "https://kierxin.github.io/The-Coolony-Game/"), [Repo](https://github.com/kierxin/The-Coolony-Game "https://github.com/kierxin/The-Coolony-Game")

> Built with vanilla JS, HTML, and SCSS, this is an ant-themed, idle-clicker-esque game that I built for the week-long JavaScript Project for App Academy. It's a front-end app where the user delegates tasks to the ants in the colony, gathering resources and discovering more tunnels, while ensuring that their ants don't starve. 

> I wrote some more about this at the project repo's [Wiki](https://github.com/kierxin/The-Coolony-Game/wiki/Wiki).
